# Enderbyte Programs Maps

On/offline OSM maps

## Installation

### Windows

- Navigate to the latest release
- Download the attached .zip file
- Extract **all** of this zip file (resist the temptation to run map.exe)
- Once you have extracted all of the zip file, then you can run map.exe

### Other OS

Note: This requires a Python installation

- Download the source code
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- If pip is not available to you or does not work, please ensure you have pygame-ce, urllib3, and psutil installed as Python packages on your system.
- Run `python3 main.py`
